<h1>Input</h1>
<p>This code relies on user input to create a list of cities and their associated country and population. Users fill out a form for each city they want added to the list with the necessary information.</p>

<h1>Process</h1>
<p>When the application opens, the App.js sends users to the home page (Home.js). Users can select from a navigation banner which page they go to first. The Add City button is linked with CityAdd.js and the City List button is linked with CityList.js. Users fill out a form on CityAdd.js and then are taken to the City List page where they should see their new city. When users click on each city, CityList.js calls on CityInfo.js which pops up the information users had previously input. If users want to add another city, they can quickly move between the list page and add page by clicking "Add city".</p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>The output is a user generated list of cities and details.</p>
